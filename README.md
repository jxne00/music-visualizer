# Music Visualizer

A music visualization web app that uses p5.js and [Meyda audio features](https://meyda.js.org/audio-features) to create dynamic visual representations by mapping audio features like rms, energy, spectral centroid, and chroma to visual parameters such as shape, size, and rotation. Additionally, voice command recognition is integrated to alter visual elements like shapes and background colors through spoken instructions.
